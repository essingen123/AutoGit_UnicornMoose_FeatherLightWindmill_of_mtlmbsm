<h2>What is MTLMBSM? ðŸ¤”</h2>
<p>MTLMBSM stands for "Meh To Less Meh But Still Meh," a humorous way to describe how 
this script simplifies and automates aspects of version control and GitHub interactions; which also serves as a filter; since if this is yet not automagically enforcing a smile near the observer, this script may not be suitable at all; almost like an admin requirement certification wise thing. </p>
<h2>Features ðŸŽ‰</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automagic operation (YES, PREFERABLY even if there's an error or missing configuration, in authentic unicorn moose manners! )</li>
<li>Flexible configuration through kigit.txt</li>
<li>Repository creation &amp; management</li>
<li>Automatic README.md &amp; .gitignore generation etc intended</li>
<li>(Yet to be more arty) web page generative actions from README.md etc</li>
<li>Customizable commit messages (-ish)</li>
<li>And much more, and perhaps even quite differently so (not so awesome) when LLMs misinterpret the "enhance" statement!</li>
</ul>
<h2>License ðŸ“œ</h2>
<p>This project is licensed under a license not written here yet.. but sure, this has probably taken out a 100 hours of LLM discoteque ettiqeuette etc.</p></body></html>
