# Auto Git Unicorn Moose Feather Light Windmill of MTLMBSM
![Auto Git Unicorn Moose Feather Light Windmill](auto_git_unicorn_moose_feather_light_windmill.webp)

This script automates the initial setup of a git repository with enhanced interactive features. It handles the creation of `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and the GitHub repository setup based on user input.

## Definition of MTLMBSM
MTLMBSM stands for "Meh To Less Meh But Still Meh." It humorously captures the essence that while git and this script have their weaknesses, they still simplify some aspects of version control.

## Features
- Checks and prompts for the creation of `kigit.txt`.
- Initializes a git repository if not already initialized.
- Creates a `.gitignore` with common ignore patterns and sensitive file protection.
- Interactively sets up a `README.md` with a simple description.
- Optionally updates `.bashrc` to include an alias for easy script execution.

## Setup
To use this script, simply download it to your preferred directory, make it executable with `chmod +x`, and run it from your terminal.

### Adding to .bashrc
The script can add an alias to your `.bashrc` for easy access. Just run the script and follow the interactive prompts.
